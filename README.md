# Estimating the Audience Segments of a Website Using Artificial Intelligence

In this project, we use artificial-intelligence pre-trained models to gain insights into website audiences, enabling more targeted communication strategies. The objective is to analyze and understand audiences by processing website content through various AI models. By extracting text, summarizing it, detecting emotions, identifying key themes, and predicted audience segments, we gain a view of how different narratives might resonate with different audience segments. This approach may help you tailor messages to meet goals and connect with audiences.

The process involves several key functions: extracting text from URLs, summarizing content, analyzing emotions, classifying text into categories,  extracting keywords and predicting audience segments. These functions work together to provide a an overview of each webpage. The results are compiled into a structured format and saved as a CSV file, offering a resource for refining content strategies and understanding audience segments. For detailed implementation, the complete code is available in this GitHub repository and an explanation is defined in this blog ...
